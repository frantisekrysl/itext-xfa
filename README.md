"Flat XFA" is a term used in relation to PDF documents, particularly those that contain forms. XFA stands for XML Forms Architecture, a technology by Adobe that allows the creation of dynamic forms within PDF files. These forms can include interactive fields, scripts, dynamic content, and more.

When a PDF is labeled as "flat XFA," it means that the form has been "flattened." This typically means that the interactive elements of the form have been removed or converted into static content. In other words, the form is no longer interactive – instead, it is displayed as a static image or text, and users can no longer fill out or edit the fields in the form.

Using flat XFA can be appropriate for archiving or in situations where it is important to preserve the final version of a document without allowing any modifications.
